    title: "How it was"
    text: "The hackathon, which was the first of its kind, brought together various airlines, travel companies, and blockchain developers coding solutions collaboratively using Winding Tree’s open source platform. <br/><br/>It was the first time that major airlines, developers, and startups worked on solutions together, openly exchanged expertise, gave feedback, contributed to each other’s hacks with fresh perspectives and picked each other’s brain in the spirit of open innovation.
